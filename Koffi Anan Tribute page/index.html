            <p>The Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre (KAIPTC) is deeply saddened by the passing of H. E.
                <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan" target="blank">Kofi Annan</a>, former
                Secretary General of the United Nations and Nobel Peace Laureate on Saturday, 18th August, 2018. Our deepest
                condolences goes to his family, the Kofi Annan Foundation, the Government and people of Ghana, Africa and
                the global community.</p>
            <p>Indeed Ghana, Africa and the world has lost a gem, an incomparable leader and an extraordinary inspirer. As a
                global leader, H. E. Kofi Annan was greatly dedicated and committed to ensuring that all of us of the human
                race had a fairer and a better place to live in this world. His sense of dedication and commitment to human
                rights, gender equality, the rule of law and sustainable development distinguished him during his career and
                leadership of the United Nations and after his retirement thence from.</p>
            <p>He was an exceptional achiever, a great motivator and a strong advocate and ardent champion of peace and
                security and sustainable development of Africa and the world. It was as a result of these remarkable
                achievements, the Ghana Armed Forces named the International Peacekeeping Training Centre in Ghana after him
                in 1998.</p>
            <p>A son of Ghana, he had a big heart and felt a special responsibility towards Africa. He was particularly
                committed to African development and deeply engaged in many initiatives, including his partnership with the
                KAIPTC on establishing the West Africa Commission on Drugs (WACD) to contribute to addressing the growing
                drugs problem in West Africa. He also chaired the Africa Progress Panel among others.</p>
            <p>He lived a selfless, fruitful and fulfilled life and in the process, reached out and touched many people with
                his great sense of kindness, concern and empathy. He compassionately rated others first, cared about making
                othersâ€™ lives far more comfortable. His personality generated humility, sympathy, patience, honesty,
                transparency, love and healing.</p>
            <p>His works, values, and principles have had and will continue to have a great influence and impact on the work
                of the KAIPTC. As an outstanding leader, KAIPTC celebrates his achievements and will continue to exhibit his
                principles and values to contributing to peace, security and sustainable development of the continent. His
                legacies will live on and continue to touch many lives and generations to come. He will be greatly missed by
                all at KAIPTC and will remain in our hearts forever.</p>
            <p>The KAIPTC has a number of programmes outlined to celebrate his remarkable life and these will be announced
                here later. May his gentle and beautiful soul rest in perfect peace.</p>
